Note (1): PWC functions offer high convergence speed but not highly accurate results, while PWL require larger memory footprint, but offer supreme numerical accuracy.

Note (2): A solver tolerance of 1e-5, should be enough for an accurate estimation.

Note (3): The "advanced inputs" option allows the user to set additional properties of the solvers. The default values return optimal results (A numerical mathematics background is suggested if you want to use other than the default values).

Note (4): MARIE v.2.0 runs very fast in GPU, since it is accompanied with a a pure CUDA written code, given the problem can fit in it. Make sure your GPU is properly connected to Matlab.
